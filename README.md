# Machine-Learning-Entire-Repository
This repository contains all my work projects while I was working as an Intern at EventBeep. 
All the filenames describe what exactly the code does.
If you want explanation for each project file open it as raw text, Everything is mentioned in Postcodes and comments.

The projects in ML Small Project folder are the important ones that work correctly with 100% accuracy.
Most of other programs from 'Demos and Intros' folder are connected to the Datas folder so be careful while entering the Path of your code
I am planning to make exe files for some of these projects and a working on it.

All codes are opensource and free to use, 
Contact me anytime if you need any kind of information or want to use one of my programs or want to disturb me for silly reasons....pls
I would be happy to assis you.
 
This is only for coding poeple who like to read other people's code and learn from it.
I will be creating a new repository for Non-Coding People soon,
Thank You
